Given a graph, G, determine the maximum independent set of vertices, V,
such that no two vertices are connected by an edge.

To run:
1. Update the ``get_token`` function to return your user-specific token value from the Leap dashboard
2. Update the ``nodes`` and ``edges`` lists as desired for your specific graph
